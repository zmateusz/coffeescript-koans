# Note how mocha uses the 'describe' function for a test suite, 
# and the 'it' function for a test
#
# Note also that arguments to functions do not need to be inside
# brackets (parentheses) - these are optional and used either 
# for clarity or where we need to impose an order on evaluation
#
# Functions in coffeeScript are denoted by the 'stabby' or ->
# Whitespace significant
#   A Function (or other block) ends when the indentation level
#   goes back out, just like Python

  it 'should expect true', ->

    # Note absence of () at the end - true is not a function

  # Sometimes we will ask you to fill in the values

  # change 'xit' to 'it' to enable the test

    (0 is '0').should.be.false # unlike JavaScript's ==
    (1 is 1).should.be.true # Why not? What should we replace it with?
    # Hint: search the Chai.js docs for 'truthy'

  # To understand reality, we must compare our expectations against reality.
